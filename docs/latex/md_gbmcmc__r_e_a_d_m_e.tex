The {\ttfamily dimension\+\_\+chain.\+dat.\+N} files contain the post-\/burnin posterior samples of the binary parameters for the subset of models that have exactly {\ttfamily N} binaries. The columns are \begin{DoxyVerb}f fdot A cos_colat long cos_inc psi phi
\end{DoxyVerb}


If there are more than one source, the sources cycle in the output (so line 1 is the first source, first posterior sample; line 2 is the second source, first posterior sample, etc).

The {\ttfamily parameter\+\_\+chain.\+dat.\+M} files should be used in concert with the {\ttfamily model\+\_\+chain.\+dat.\+M} files. {\ttfamily model\+\_\+chain.\+dat.\+M} records how many binaries were in the model at each M\+C\+MC step; there are a corresponding number of lines in {\ttfamily parameter\+\_\+chain.\+dat.\+M} for that step\textquotesingle{}s binary parameters (i.\+e. {\ttfamily parameter\+\_\+chain.\+dat.\+M} contains a mashed-\/together compilation of the {\ttfamily dimension\+\_\+chain.\+dat.\+N} files). The index {\ttfamily M} for these files refers to the {\itshape temperature} of the parallel-\/tempered chain that is producing these outputs ({\ttfamily M = 0} is the target distribution; {\ttfamily M $>$ 0} is softened versions of this distribution; if you don\textquotesingle{}t know what this means, you want {\ttfamily M=0}). Unline {\ttfamily dimension\+\_\+chain.\+dat.\+N} files, these files contain {\itshape all} samples including burnin. Unless you care deeply about checkpointing or run diagnostics, you do not need these files. Use {\ttfamily dimension\+\_\+chain.\+dat.\+N} files, as described above.
